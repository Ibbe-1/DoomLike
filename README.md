# DoomLike

A simple hobby project inspired by old retro shooters, specifically **Doom**.  

## Gameplay

- Defeating enemies heals the player.
- There are **5 maps**, and once completed, the game loops with increased difficulty by adding more enemies.

## Features

- Basic retro style shooter.
- Health bar with floating damage/heal indicators.
- Multiple maps with progressive difficulty.
- Weapon animations and sound effects.
- Background music that changes with levels.

## Controls

- `W` / `S` – Move forward/backward  
- `A` / `D` – Rotate left/right  
- `Space` – Shoot  

## Notes

This is a personal hobby project that I made for fun and an experiment in recreating retro shooter mechanics in C# using Windows Forms.
